the dependencies. Install `uv` first if you don't have it yet, then follow
these steps:

1. Clone this repository.

2. Run `uv sync` to create a virtualenv and install all the dependencies
   in it.

3. Run `uv run ap-uploader -p 192.168.4.1 firmware.apj` to upload the
   given firmware to a drone that is accessible via UDP packets on 192.168.4.1.
